		<h2>OUR TRAINERS </h2>
		 <p1>Terrence Zhonas – Former united rugby league player.I care deeply about my clients, and there’s nothing of more value to me than helping somebody go through an experience that makes them happy, confident, and strong. I realize how being overweight affects many aspects of your life, and I want to be there for you and help you discover the benefits and joys of training that helped me become the person I am today. I’m here to be your personal guide on every step of the journey.<br> <br>

Stafford Gray – When I first began my adventure with fitness I was anything but the picture of health. I was very overweight and I realized it was because of eating fast food and drinking pop and beer on a regular basis. I decided to do something about it. I immersed myself in a new lifestyle and have never regretted it.

			 I did, however, have multiple ups and downs. It took me years to make a decision to thoroughly examine my workouts and make necessary changes.

			 Learning about the benefits of Metabolic Training and HIIT entirely transformed my body. What I enjoy the most about it is that there is minimal or even NO equipment required and you can do it anytime and anywhere.
<br> <br>
Adrienne Michowski - Former Boxer.I’m very passionate about helping others find happiness in life and feel good about themselves. I believe that when you FEEL GOOD, you excel in life.
